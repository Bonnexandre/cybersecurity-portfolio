# Security Monitoring in M&A – Integration Case Study (Stub)

## Status
🚧 Documentation in progress (portfolio stub)

## Objective
Analyze security monitoring risks during mergers and acquisitions and propose
a monitoring integration approach to reduce blind spots and data exposure.

## What I’m adding next
- Key monitoring gaps when two orgs merge (tools, logs, identities)
- SIEM onboarding strategy and normalization approach
- Governance/PMO alignment and incident escalation path

## Notes
This will be expanded into a practical playbook-style analysis.
