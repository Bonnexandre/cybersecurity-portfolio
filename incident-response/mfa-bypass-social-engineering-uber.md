# MFA Bypass & Social Engineering – Uber Case Study (Stub)

## Status
🚧 Documentation in progress (portfolio stub)

## Objective
Analyze a real-world identity-focused breach involving social engineering and
MFA fatigue to extract defensive lessons for organizations.

## What I’m adding next
- Attacker technique summary (social engineering + push fatigue)
- Defensive controls (number matching, phishing-resistant MFA, policies)
- Detection/response improvements and user awareness measures

## Notes
This will be expanded into an incident-analysis format with mitigations.
