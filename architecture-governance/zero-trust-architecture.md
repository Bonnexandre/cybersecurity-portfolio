# Zero Trust Architecture – Enterprise Security Design

## Objective
Analyze and explain a Zero Trust security model focused on identity-first
security and continuous verification to reduce breach impact.

## Scenario
Traditional perimeter-based security models fail to protect modern
distributed environments. This project evaluates Zero Trust principles
as applied to enterprise and healthcare contexts.

## Analysis
Zero Trust removes implicit trust by enforcing strict identity
verification, device validation, and least-privilege access.
Core components include:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control
- Continuous monitoring and auditing

## Defensive Perspective
Implementing Zero Trust helps organizations:
- Reduce lateral movement
- Limit breach blast radius
- Improve visibility and compliance

## Key Takeaways
- Trust should never be assumed
- Identity is the new security perimeter
- Continuous verification is essential
