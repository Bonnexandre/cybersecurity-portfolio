## Status
🚧 Documentation in progress (portfolio stub)

## Objective
Summarize how the CIS Critical Security Controls can be applied to reduce
organizational risk through prioritized, practical security measures.

## What I’m adding next
- Mapping CIS Controls to common incident scenarios (phishing, unpatched systems)
- Recommended implementation priorities for small-to-mid environments
- Defensive takeaways aligned to SOC/Blue Team operations

## Notes
This write-up will be expanded into a structured analysis with actionable
controls and examples.
