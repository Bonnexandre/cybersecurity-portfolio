# Authentication & Injection Failures – Focused OWASP Analysis (Stub)

## Status
🚧 Documentation in progress (portfolio stub)

## Objective
Document common authentication weaknesses and injection flaws, explain impact,
and outline remediation strategies aligned with OWASP best practices.

## What I’m adding next
- Common authentication failure patterns (sessions, passwords, MFA gaps)
- Injection examples and prevention (parameterized queries, validation)
- Secure implementation checklist for developers

## Notes
This will be expanded with clear mitigation steps and security takeaways.
