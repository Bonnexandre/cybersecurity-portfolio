# Cryptographic Failures – TLS & Secure Configuration Lessons (Stub)

## Status
🚧 Documentation in progress (portfolio stub)

## Objective
Explain how cryptographic implementation flaws and insecure configurations can
cause data exposure, and summarize best practices to prevent these failures.

## What I’m adding next
- Root cause patterns (weak protocols, bad key mgmt, misconfig)
- Secure TLS configuration checklist
- Practical lessons for engineering and security teams

## Notes
This will be expanded with structured findings and defensive takeaways.
